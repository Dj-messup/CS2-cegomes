Fraction Calculator




Background:
We learned how to perform simple operations on fractions. Now we will code up those same operations using classes and operator overloading.


Tasks:


You will implement a simple fraction calculator in C++ using a Fraction class to store each fraction and the code to overload the +, -, *, /, ==, and << operators.
1. Download skeleton code and all files from: https://github.com/jeremybergen/CSCI112/tree/main/Labs/Lab3 and place it inside of a folder named Lab3 inside of your Labs folder.
2. You are only allowed to modify fractions.cpp functions.
3. Do not add any libraries to any file unless approved ahead of time!
4. To test your code, you can type: make && make run. This will compile your code and run main. The code in main also has a conditional so if you do: make && make test, that will run two automated tests
5. When main is run, it will create two fractions. Those fractions will call the default constructor which should prompt for the numerator and denominator if one is not passed into it.
6. Then cout will print out to the console in the following format:
   1. <frac1> + <frac2> = <sum>
   2. Ex: 2/3 + 3/4 = 17/12
7. Update README.md
8. Submit screenshot to D2L of program running
9. All code must be uploaded to GitHub
10. Follow standard coding styles including adding comments as necessary to clarify complex sections of code


Example output:
./main.out
Fraction 1: 
Enter numerator: 2
Enter denominator: 3
Fraction 2: 
Enter numerator: 3
Enter denominator: 4
2/3 + 3/4 = 17/12
2/3 - 3/4 = -1/12
2/3 * 3/4 = 1/2
2/3 / 3/4 = 8/9
