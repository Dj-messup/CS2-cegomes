BST




Background:
We learned about Binary Search Trees in class along with the theory behind them. You will now implement a templated BST. It is suggested to start with the constructor and then the empty method.


Tasks:


You will implement a BST in C++ using a templated BST class to store the tree with the following operations; insert, inOrder, search, remove.
1. Download skeleton code and all files from: https://github.com/jeremybergen/CSCI112/tree/main/Labs/Lab5 and place it inside of a folder named Lab5 inside of your Labs folder.
2. You are only allowed to modify tree.h functions.
3. Do not add any libraries to any file unless approved ahead of time!
4. To test your code, you can type: make && make run. This will compile your code and run main. The code in main also has a conditional so if you do: make && make test, that will run automated tests
5. When main is run, it will prompt for ints until -999 is entered. Then it will perform different operations on the list.
6. Update README.md
7. Submit screenshot to D2L of program running
8. All code must be uploaded to GitHub
9. Follow standard coding styles including adding comments as necessary to clarify complex sections of code


Example output:
./main.out
Enter a value to add to the tree. Enter -999 to stop: 42
42
Enter a value to add to the tree. Enter -999 to stop: 15
15 42
Enter a value to add to the tree. Enter -999 to stop: 32
15 32 42
Enter a value to add to the tree. Enter -999 to stop: 1523
15 32 42 1523
Enter a value to add to the tree. Enter -999 to stop: 2
2 15 32 42 1523
Enter a value to add to the tree. Enter -999 to stop: 142
2 15 32 42 142 1523
Enter a value to add to the tree. Enter -999 to stop: 322
2 15 32 42 142 322 1523
Enter a value to add to the tree. Enter -999 to stop: 14
2 14 15 32 42 142 322 1523
Enter a value to add to the tree. Enter -999 to stop: -999
