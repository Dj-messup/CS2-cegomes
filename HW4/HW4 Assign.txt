Word Counter




Background:
You will implement a word counter in C++ using classes including operator overloading and storing each word in a BST. The code from Lab5 can be used for the node and tree files. Skeleton code is provided for you if you would like.


Tasks:


You will implement a BST in C++ using a templated BST class to store the tree with the following operations; insert, inOrder, search, remove.
1. Download skeleton code and all files from: https://github.com/jeremybergen/CSCI112/tree/main/Assignments/HW4 and place it inside of a folder named Final inside of your Assignments folder.
2. Do not add any libraries to any file unless approved ahead of time!
3. To test your code, you can type: make && make run. This will compile your code and run main. The code in main also has a conditional so if you do: make && make test, that will run automated tests
4. When main is run, it will prompt for a text file, read it in and then print out the words along with their frequency.
5. Update README.md
6. Submit screenshot to D2L of program running
7. All code must be uploaded to GitHub
8. Follow standard coding styles including adding comments as necessary to clarify complex sections of code
