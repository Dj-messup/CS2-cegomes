### Lab 1

Name: Game of Life
Date: 09/18/24
Grade: 31.5/35
Notes: I was not going to submit it because my code was ALL OVER THE PLACE, I worked on it with a couple of my friends and it definetly showed the contrasting ideas and forgot to clean it up for final review/grade.

### Lab 2

Name: Point Distance
Date: 08/16/24
Grade: B
Notes: Your distance between points is the squared distance but typically you'll then take and return the sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2). Your code will calculated the squared distance however the test cases do not work because I check based on the distance.
